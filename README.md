This is a program that shows several algorithms to solve the TSP.

When running, click or press space to access the (rather limited) commands.
So far only three algorithms have been implemented, brute force, nearest neighbour and christofides'*.

*Christofides' algorthim doesn't seem to work particularly well, I'll probably fix it at some point, but don't count on it.
